# Explore-US-bikeshare-data

This project's goal was to explore data from three .csv files, representing bike renting data across three states.  
Completed in partial fulfillment to the Udacity data analysis professional nanodegree.  

This interactive python script filters three datasets by month and weekday and provides information about Time, Station, Trip Duration, and Users.   It also has a feature to display raw data. It is user-friendly & self-explanatory.
